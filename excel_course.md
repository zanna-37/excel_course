## Basic topics

### Change language
Using Excel in English is a good idea because it's easier to find help online. To change the language, go to `File > Options > Language` and set the `Display Language` to `English`. Then restart Excel.

### Select a range of cells
In order to **select all cells** in the current sheet, press the small square button in the top left corner of the sheet, between the column and row headers.

`ðŸ’¡ TIP:` _You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + A`._

To **select entire rows or columns**, click on the row or column header. To select multiple rows or columns, click on the first row or column header and drag the mouse until satisfied.

To select a **range of cells**, click on the first cell and drag the mouse to the last cell. To select **multiple ranges** of cells, hold the `Ctrl` key while selecting the ranges.

`ðŸ’¡ TIP:` _To expand or shrink the selection, press and hold the `Shift` key while using the arrow keys. Use `Ctrl + Shift + Arrow` to expand the selection to the last non-empty cell._

### Auto-resize rows and columns
To auto-resize columns, double-click on the right border of the column header. You can also select multiple columns and double-click the border of any of them to resize all.

The same applies to rows.

### Add a new line in a cell
To add a new line in a cell, simply press `Alt + Enter`. To facilitate writing, you can also expand the text box by pressing the arrow on the right side of it. Then drag the lower border to expand vertically.

### Wrap text
If you have a long text inside a cell and you want it to be wrapped according to the cell width, you can use the `Wrap Text` button in the `Home` tab.
